## How to launch?
The project does not use any third-party libraries, so it's enough to simply open it in XCode version 15 or 16 and run the application on a simulator or device. 
For installation on a device, iOS 17.0 or newer is required. Additionally, in the IDE, go to the 'Signing & Capabilities' tab in the xcodeproj. 
In this tab, change the Team and the Bundle Identifier to a different value.

## How could the application be improved?
- Provide more tests for both of reducers
- Using borders property from county info and open countries neighbor
- Add MapKit or 3rd party library to display location inside App
- Make search field looking not so boring :)
- Make localisation, at least for displaying country name
